its just a simple script to help you download youtube videos and also the entire video in a playlist

Its also automtically create a directory with the playlist name and also appends the index of the video to the video names

Its helps me because most times that i download videos from youtube using apps like videmate with my android device for other video downloading softwares out there, the videos do scatter and i dont ususally know which video comes first and i may want to download multiple playlist and after downloading them, i dont know which playlist each videos comes from

Like i may want to download videos from  different channels or even from the same channel but with different playlist, at the end of the day, i dont know which playlist eact video comes from

It also downloads single videos
